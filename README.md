LinkedIn Learning course by Angie Jones.

## Course details

Java is one of the most popular programming languages in the world, running on billions of devices across the globe. As
such, being able to program in Java is a highly sought-after skill. This course with certified Java developer Angie
Jones provides the foundation for learning how to program with the most recent Long-Term-Support (LTS) release, Java 17.
Angie shows how to install Java and IntelliJ IDEA, a leading Java IDE, and start working with variables, data types, and
other critical language components. She also helps you control program flow with conditional logic and loops, store data
with Java collections, and understand how Java implements object-oriented coding principles such as inheritance. Angie
